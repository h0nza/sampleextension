2003-07-02  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* README:           Added notes for the win/ build files.
	
	* win/Makefile.vc:  Patch #762878 applied to provide a sample VC++
	* win/rules.vc:     build system. This is NOT TEA but is a useful
	* win/nmakehlp.c:   alternative for win32 developers.

2003-04-04  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* configure.in:
	* tclconfig/tcl.m4: Updated to newest tcl.m4, regenerated
	  configure's.

2003-02-25  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* README: Add generic unix build instructions
	and suggest the msys + mingw build process
	described in tcl/win/README.
	* README.cygwin: Remove Cygwin specific info since
	this is now covered in the README file.
	[Tc Patch 679416]

2002-10-15  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* configure:
	* configure.in: move the CFLAGS definition into TEA_ENABLE_SHARED
	and make it pick up the env CFLAGS at configure time.

2002-07-11  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* Makefile.in: make TCL_DEFS come first in DEFS to that our DEFS
	would redefine the Tcl ones.

	* generic/tclsample.c: renamed Sha1 to Sha1_Cmd to better follow
	convention

2002-04-22  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* configure: regen'ed
	* configure.in (CLEANFILES): added pkgIndex.tcl

	* README.cygwin: improved notes on using cygwin.

2002-04-03  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* Makefile.in: improved use of DESTDIR in install targets.
	Removed need for installdirs target.
	Broke TCLSH_PROG into TCLSH_ENV and TCLSH_PROG with TCLSH var and
	added comments about TCLSH_ENV.
	Added default shell and gdb targets.
	Added comments about using RUNTIME_SOURCES var.

	* README.cygwin: updated notes about using mingw gcc as a compiler.

	* configure: 
	* configure.in: updated to new TEA base that: prefixes all macros
	with TEA_* instead of SC_*; adds TEA_PREFIX, which defaults the
	prefix and exec_prefix values to what Tcl used; adds
	TEA_SETUP_COMPILER, which handles basic compiler / support program
	checks and simplifies the configure.in.

2002-04-01  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* Makefile.in (install-lib-binaries): ensure that binary files are
	installed with executable bit set (use INSTALL_PROGRAM)

2002-03-29  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* configure: regen'ed from changed tclconfig/tcl.m4

	* generic/tclsample.c: added #include <string.h> for strlen /
	strcmp declarations.

2002-03-28  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* Makefile.in: moved setting TCLLIBPATH to the test target because
	that is where it is needed, added a little doc about it.

	* configure:
	* configure.in: BUILD_${PACKAGE} had to be static BUILD_sample in
	AC_DEFINE because autoconf wasn't substituting ${PACKAGE}.

	* tests/all.tcl: added message about starting pwd

2002-03-27  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* Makefile.in (TCLSH_PROG): moved and updated env var definitions
	to have tclsh work from build dir.  Removed TCL_EXTRA_CFLAGS,
	TCL_LD_FLAGS, TCL_SHLIB_LD_LIBS, TCL_DBGX, TCL_STUB_LIB_FILE,
	TCL_STUB_LIB_SPEC as they aren't needed (configure acquires all
	that info for us).  TCL_LIBS is also not needed, but left in as a
	reference to the libs Tcl used.

	* configure: regen based on updated tclconfig/tcl.m4
	* configure.in: moved the SHLIB_LD_LIBS magic into
	tclconfig/tcl.m4 and noted where users can modify (SHLIB_LD_)LIBS.

2002-03-20  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* Makefile.in (install-binaries): corrected if shell error
	[Bug #532557] (virden)

2002-03-19  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* README:
	* mkIndex.tcl.in (removed): removed the need for this script by
	simplifying the default install structure to use pkglibdir for the
	main dynamic library file generated.

	* configure:
	* configure.in: use double eval on the ${PACKAGE}_LIB_FILE to
	substitute the ${DBGX} variable.
	Remove output of the mkIndex.tcl script.

	* Makefile.in: added pkgIndex.tcl to binaries dependencies.
	Removed use of mkIndex.tcl script.  Simple pkgIndex.tcl target
	added and install-lib-binaries modified to use pkglibdir instead
	of bindir and libdir directories.

2002-03-12  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* configure: regenerated
	* configure.in: removed pulling (UN)SHARED_LIB_SUFFIX from
	tclConfig.sh as these are defined by SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS.

	* Makefile.in (TCLSH_PROG): added a viable TCL_LIBRARY for when
	the TCLSH_PROG is a built, but not installed, executable.
	(install-binaries, test, LIB_FILE): use	$($(PACKAGE)_LIB_FILE)
	instead of directly referencing package name to reduce number of
	lines that need changing.
	(dist): removed install of no longer existent tclconfig/config.*

2002-03-11  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* Makefile.in:
	* doc/sha1.n: moved from sha1.n
	* generic/sample.c: moved from sample.c
	* generic/sample.h: moved from sample.h
	* generic/tclsample.c: moved from tclsample.c

2002-03-06  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* Makefile.in: add EXTRA_SOURCES, WIN_SOURCES, UNIX_SOURCES
	example lines, remove $(sample_LIB_FILE)_OBJECTS problematic
	macro, move lib_BINARIES and BINARIES as they don't need editing.
	Replace $(mkinstalldirs) with "mkdir -p", added $(srcdir)/unix to
	VPATH, removed inclusion of tclconfig/installFile.tcl and
	tclconfig/mkinstalldirs in dist: target.

	* aclocal.m4: added comments

2002-03-05  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* Makefile.in: removed unused @vars@.  Cleaned up targets.  Added
	dist and dist-clean generic targets.  Improved use of OBJEXT.

	* configure.in: bumped package to 0.3, cleaned up macro usage.

	* README: 
	* README.cygwin: 
	* aclocal.m4:
	* configure (new):
	* install-sh, mkinstalldirs, tcl.m4 (removed): complete revamp to
	use the tclconfig updated TEA module

	* exampleA.c, sample.c:
	* exampleA.h, sample.h:
	* tclexampleA.c, tclsample.c: s/exampleA/sample/g

2001-05-21  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4: 419812

2000-06-26  Mike Thomas  <wart@scriptics.com>

	* Makefile.in:  Changed TCLTESTARGS to TESTFLAGS in test: target.

2000-02-03  Mike Thomas  <wart@scriptics.com>

	* tests/:  Added tests subdirectory with sample test files
	* Makefile.in:  Added test target to Makefile.
	* configure.in: Added hooks for when we later move some of the config
	files to a subdirectory.

2000-02-02  Mike Thomas  <wart@scriptics.com>

	* configure.in:
	* Makefile.in: Applied patch from Andreas Kupries to fix install
	problems when building static libraries.

2000-01-24  Mike Thomas  <wart@scriptics.com>

	* tcl.m4: Look for CYGWIN_98 and CYGWIN_95 environments, not just
	CYGWIN_NT.  Also search for executables with the $EXEEXT extension
	in SC_PROG_TCLSH and SC_PROG_WISH so that we don't pick up MS VS
	junk files.
	* configure.in:  Changes to support building on Win 95/98 using
	the cygwin environment.
